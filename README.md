After being inspired by this *very* old meme, I decided to implement this functionality myself! This standalone program lets you test your mind (and maybe your friends' too) by easily mixing up the letters of a message you provide, without changing the first and last letter of each word.

To run this program, simply download the [compiled .jar file](https://github.com/maxgreen01/TextScrambler/releases/tag/v1.0) and run it on an environment with at least Java 8 already installed.

This program uses Java Swing to build the UI, and bundles Apache Commons Lang for very minor use in the scrambling process.
